Grid: Infinite 2D grid of live/dead cells.

Neighbors: Each cell has 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

Transitions (Simultaneous):
Underpopulation: Live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies.
Survival: Live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives.
Overpopulation: Live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies.
Reproduction: Dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes live.
